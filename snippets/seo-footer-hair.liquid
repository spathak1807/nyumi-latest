    <h2>
      The Key Ingredients of Hair Growth Gummies
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our hair gummies are made from a perfect formulation of traditional homely Indian ingredients and state of the art Western science to give you healthy, nourished hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nyumi Biotin Hair Gummies simplify vitamin intake for healthy hair through ingredients like Biotin, Zinc, Choline, Inositol, Selenium, Folic Acid & Vitamin B12.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Biotin
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is often found in hair gummies for its immense potential to support hair health. 
      Biotin works to strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote hair growth. It can be your secret to having good hair days for days.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Zinc
    </h3>
    <p>
      Zinc is essential for hair growth and repair. It helps maintain the health of hair follicles, prevents hair loss, and supports the production of new hair cells. 
      Zinc in our hair gummies contribute to thicker and stronger hair.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Choline
    </h3>
    <p>
      Choline supports overall hair health by assisting in the production of structural proteins like keratin. Keratin is a crucial component of hair which makes hair strong and sturdy. Without enough keratin, hair can become weak and prone to damage. 
      Choline helps maintain its integrity when included in hair gummies.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Selenium
    </h3>
    <p>
      Selenium is an essential mineral that helps keep hair healthy by preventing oxidative damage to the hair follicles. Selenium also helps maintain a healthy scalp, reducing dandruff and itchiness. 
      Its role in supporting proper hormone function indirectly contributes to hair health. Overall, selenium aids in the maintenance of strong, shiny, and lustrous hair.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Folic Acid
    </h3>
    <p>
      Folic acid is a vital B vitamin that plays a crucial role in hair health. 
      It aids in the formation of red blood cells, which transport oxygen and nutrients to hair follicles. 
      This promotes hair growth and prevents hair loss. 
      Folic acid also contributes to the overall health and thickness of hair, making it an essential nutrient for maintaining vibrant and lush hair.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Vitamin B12
    </h3>
    <p>
      A deficiency in B12 can lead to weak, brittle hair. Including sufficient B12 in your diet ensures strong, vibrant hair. 
      Like Folic Acid, this vitamin plays a crucial role in the formation of red blood cells, which carry oxygen and other nutrients to hair follicles.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Inositol
    </h3>
    <p>
      Inositol is often included in hair gummies due to its potential to prevent hair thinning and promote healthy hair growth. 
      It plays a role in maintaining the cellular health of hair follicles. 
      Inositol helps hair cells communicate and function properly, leading to stronger, healthier hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with these ingredients, our hair gummies also contain; Vitamin A, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin D2, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B6, and Iodine. All of these ingredients combine to give you a multitude of benefits for healthy hair.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Role Of Biotin Supplements In Managing Deficiency
    </h2>
    <p>
     Here are several ways in which biotin supplements may help improve hair health: 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Strengthening Your Hair
    </h3>
    <p>
      Biotin is known to fortify the structure of hair strands, reducing breakage and split ends. 
      Stronger hair is less prone to damage, making it appear healthier and more vibrant. 
      Biotin is essential for the production of keratin, a protein that makes up the majority of hair's composition. 
      Keratin is responsible for providing hair with its strength and structure. 
      Biotin ensures an adequate supply of keratin, which, in turn, makes hair less prone to damage. 
      It also enhances the hair's elasticity, allowing it to stretch without breaking. 
      This is especially important for hair that is exposed to heat styling, chemical treatments, or environmental stressors.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Improved Hair Growth
    </h3>
    <p>
      While biotin won't necessarily stimulate hair growth in people not deficient in the vitamin, it supports the overall health of existing hair, allowing it to grow longer and at a healthier rate. 
      Biotin helps in nourishing hair follicles and promoting a healthy environment for hair growth. 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Improved Hair Volume
    </h3>
    <p>
      Biotin can contribute to thicker hair by improving hair follicle strength and hair density. 
      This can make the hair appear fuller and more voluminous. Biotin supports the health of hair follicles, the structures responsible for hair growth. 
      Healthy follicles are more likely to produce thicker, healthier hair strands, which can enhance volume.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Prevents Hair Loss
    </h3>
    <p>
      Biotin deficiency is linked to hair loss, so ensuring you have an adequate supply of biotin may prevent or reduce hair loss, especially if the loss is due to a deficiency. 
      Adequate biotin levels ensure that hair remains anchored in the follicles, reducing the risk of excessive shedding.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Improved Scalp Health
    </h3>
    <p>
      Biotin is believed to contribute to a healthier scalp, which can indirectly benefit hair health. Most people ignore issues with their scalp and this can compound existing hair issues. 
      Here are <a href='https://nyumi.com/blogs/news/10-healthy-scalp-tips-benefits'> 10 healthy scalp tips & benefits </a> for you to combine with our hair gummies.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Improve Nail Health
    </h3>
    <p>
      Stronger nails are often associated with improved hair health, as both hair and nails are composed of a protein called keratin. 
      Biotin can help reduce nail brittleness and enhance their overall quality. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's essential to recognize that the impact of biotin hair deficiency on hair health can vary from person to person. 
      Biotin gummies can address deficiency when combined with <a href='https://nyumi.com/products/iron-gummies-for-women'>iron gummies </a> for hair, they can help address issues related to hair growth and strength. 
      The <a href='https://nyumi.com/products/hairfall-defense-kit'>Nyumi Hairfall Defense Kit</a> is the perfect combo for you if you are facing hair problems.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How Do Biotin Hair Gummies Work?
    </h2>
    <p>

    <h2>
      How to Incorporate Hair Gummies into Your Routine
    </h2>
    <p>
      Biotin hair gummies are easy to incorporate into your daily routine. 
      Just 2 gummies daily after a meal should help you get the right nutrients for nourished, healthy hair.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Time Frame for Biotin Gummies To Get The Results?
    </h2>
    <p>

      Biotin for hair growth only works if taken consistently, although biotin deficiency is rare, biotin supplements taken regularly ensure that you at least get the right nutrients to ensure healthy hair growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our gummies are clinically proven to show results in 90 days.
