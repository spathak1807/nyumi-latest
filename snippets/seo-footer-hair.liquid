      The Key Ingredients Hair Growth Gummies
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our hair gummies are made from a perfect formulation of traditional homely Indian ingredients and state of the art Western science to give you healthy, nourished hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nyumi Biotin Hair Gummies simplify vitamin intake for healthy hair through ingredients like Biotin, Zinc, Choline, Inositol, Selenium, Folic Acid & Vitamin B12.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Biotin
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is often found in hair gummies for its immense potential to support hair health. 
      Biotin works to strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote hair growth. It can be your secret to having good hair days for days.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Zinc
    </h3>
    <p>
      Zinc is essential for hair growth and repair. It helps maintain the health of hair follicles, prevents hair loss, and supports the production of new hair cells. 
      Zinc in our hair gummies contribute to thicker and stronger hair.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Choline
    </h3>
    <p>
      Choline supports overall hair health by assisting in the production of structural proteins like keratin. Keratin is a crucial component of hair which makes hair strong and sturdy. Without enough keratin, hair can become weak and prone to damage. 
      Choline helps maintain its integrity when included in hair gummies.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Selenium
    </h3>
    <p>
      Selenium is an essential mineral that helps keep hair healthy by preventing oxidative damage to the hair follicles. Selenium also helps maintain a healthy scalp, reducing dandruff and itchiness. 
      Its role in supporting proper hormone function indirectly contributes to hair health. Overall, selenium aids in the maintenance of strong, shiny, and lustrous hair.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Folic Acid
    </h3>
    <p>
      Folic acid is a vital B vitamin that plays a crucial role in hair health. 
      It aids in the formation of red blood cells, which transport oxygen and nutrients to hair follicles. 
      This promotes hair growth and prevents hair loss. 
      Folic acid also contributes to the overall health and thickness of hair, making it an essential nutrient for maintaining vibrant and lush hair.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Vitamin B12
    </h3>
    <p>
      A deficiency in B12 can lead to weak, brittle hair. Including sufficient B12 in your diet ensures strong, vibrant hair. 
      Like Folic Acid, this vitamin plays a crucial role in the formation of red blood cells, which carry oxygen and other nutrients to hair follicles.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Inositol
    </h3>
    <p>
      Inositol is often included in hair gummies due to its potential to prevent hair thinning and promote healthy hair growth. 
      It plays a role in maintaining the cellular health of hair follicles. 
      Inositol helps hair cells communicate and function properly, leading to stronger, healthier hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with these ingredients, our hair gummies also contain; Vitamin A, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin D2, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B6, and Iodine. All of these ingredients combine to give you a multitude of benefits for healthy hair.
